# odin-imgui

This is an odin wrapper for [dear imgui v1.91.3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (Generated from the auto-generated [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui.git)).

It contains generated wrappers as well as handwritten ones to make it better fit with the odin language.
It will also contain extra utility functions that are not present in cimgui.

## Building cimgui
If you want to build cimgui yourself instead of using the binaries that exist in the repo, you can just call `make cimgui` from a command prompt that has `cl` and `link` in their path.
